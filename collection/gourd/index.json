  "description": "This vessel is made from a hollowed-out ubo, a marrow-like vegetable.Gourds, where they grow, are often used to make practical objects. They are light, durable and easily available, and in the Somali region often used for transporting water for drinking and for storing water for washing in preparation for prayer. This water carrier is richly decorated in a geometric style.",
